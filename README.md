# Overview of the Project

# Project : Student Grade Tracker
The Student Grade Tracker is a Python program designed to help students, teachers, or parents easily manage and track the academic performance of students across various subjects. The program will allow users to input marks for different subjects, calculate the average score, determine the grade based on predefined criteria, and provide a summary of the student's performance.

## Objective
### Main Objective:
To develop a Python program that enables users to efficiently track and manage student grades across multiple subjects.
### Secondary Objectives:
Simplify the process of calculating and recording student marks.
Provide an easy-to-understand performance summary that includes the average marks and overall grade.
Enhance the transparency of academic progress for both students and educators.

## Key Activities
### User Input:
Allow users to input student names and marks for different subjects.
Handle input validation to ensure marks are within an acceptable range.

### Data Storage:
Store student information and subject marks in a structured format, such as a dictionary or list of dictionaries.

### Grade Calculation:
Implement logic to calculate the average marks for each student.
Define a grading scale (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) and assign grades based on the average marks.

### Performance Summary:
Generate a summary report showing each studentâ€™s marks, average, and grade.
Optionally, provide feedback or suggestions based on the performance.

### User Interface:
Create a simple text-based interface for entering data and viewing results.
Optionally, extend the program with a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.

## Additional Points
### Extensibility:
The program should be designed in a modular way, allowing for future extensions such as adding more subjects, handling multiple students, or exporting data to a file.
### Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to manage incorrect inputs and ensure the program runs smoothly.
### User Feedback: 
Provide clear and informative messages to guide the user through the process.
### Documentation:
Include comments in the code and possibly a user manual to explain how to use the program.

This structure will help ensure that your program is both functional and user-friendly, making it easier for users to track and manage student grades.
